2021-04-10,PLTR,5-10,23|22|21,20,,8,for palantir technologies i took algorithm extensions to project the targets. if you want more of these charts i provide many of these to my premium members where you can buy the specific stocks right now. cut - loss should be anything below $20. just to note we are getting sell-readings on my indicator. i would not chase and let the trades come within the buy-zone to avoid any mediocre risk-to-reward scenarios.
2021-04-10,SHAK,4-8,111|107|103,90,,5,i like the strong uptrend and the sideways action towards my moving averages. i like that the moving averages are holding the price up. and i like the fact that we are technical price levels right now that make sense as a buy. the only risk would be that the strong buy-zone level is further down than i want it to be. but everything looks solid to me.
2021-04-10,ICE,4-8,115|112|110,106,,6,i do believe intercontinental exchange could continue moving higher - i really like the current consolidation and how the moving averages are supporting price. the only risk however would be the fact that the indicators are getting a little toppy. i wouldn’t chase if you miss this trade - let the trades form.
2021-04-10,UNFI,4-8,35|34|33,30,,5,the banking algos make complete sense to me. and again if you want more of these charts and analysis for companies that people have never heard of yet you can always support my channel by becoming a premium member. you’ll gain access to these charts like united natural foods. there is a possibility that we can hold these price lows - and anything above $30 is still bullish in my opinion. i really like that we are holding the moving averages and it’s still keeping its strong uptrend. the only risk would be if my count is completely wrong and we fall further down closer to $26 per share. hence why i have a cut-loss under $30 to mitigate risk.
2021-04-10,SEAS,4-8,50|49|48,45,,8,the thing i like is the whtie trend line support that will try and keep price up- - i also like the sideways action that typically represents wave 4’s. the only risk would be that price is pressed against a very strong resistance level on the weekly timeframe. this could be a “fake” consolidation that ultimately has too much selling pressure here at these levels and drop seaworld closer to $40 per share. all in all i am 50/50 on this trade but something to keep in mind if you want to diversify your portfolio a bit of both a recovery and covid environment.
2021-04-10,TSN,4-8,76|75|74,73,,7,i like the algorithmic levels of support and the white trendline support that will act as a price floor if tyson foods dips in the future. notice price has continuously held my moving averages in orange blue and red as well. the main risk behind this trade would be the fact that the indicators are in overbought territory. however it has not flashed a sell-reading as of yet. so there is still time to continue moving higher.
2021-04-10,NTES,4-8,106|102|99,96,,6,i really like that it has fallen to the golden ratio of the 6.18 bank algorithms and if we can hold these lows there is a algo flip towards potentially $146 dollar per share which is a solid 43% gain in the future. cut -losses should be underneath 6.18 bank algorithm to ensure proper risk-to-reward scenarios. overall we are trying to catch a bottom within an uptrend.
2021-04-10,APPS,5-10,80|77|73,67,,5,i like that the price has held up nicely over the course of the tech sell-offs we’ve seen in february. i also like the strong price levels across the bank algos that i’m seeing here. the only risk is the fact that we are at short-term resistance - there may be a small dip in the future closer to the mid $70 dollar per share mark.
2021-04-10,UPST,4-8,125|123|120,111,,7,with a recent ipo i had to try and decipher very volatile price movements. i currently have us in a wave 4 in yellow with a potential price target closer to $200 if we continue moving up. i like the current flag formation within my grey channel price is moving within. and i like the fact that the moving averages are supporting price action so far. the main risk would be that the cut-loss is not at the most optimal area of $111. but this is the lowest i can put my cut-loss to make sure the risk-reward scenario is favorable for the bulls. additionally my count may be completely wrong as well that would drop upstart closer to $90 per share.
2021-04-10,PLUG,5-10,32|30|28,25,,9,i like that we are at the golden ratio banking algorithm of the .618 level. if we can hold these lows we have a chance at $47 dollars per share medium-term. cut - losses should be underneath the golden ratio level around $24 dollars per share. all in all i’m hoping these levels can hold - however again price can always go lower and the markets are irrational.
